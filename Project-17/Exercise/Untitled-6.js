// Here are 10 beginner-level programming questions similar to your examples:

// 1. **Write a function to calculate a 20% discount on a product price.**
//    Input: A price
//    Output: The discounted price

// 2. **Create an array of fruits (e.g., Apple, Orange, Banana).**
//    Write a loop to display:
//    `I like [fruit name]` for each item in the array.

// 3. **Create an array of numbers (5, 8, 12, 15, 20).**
//    Write a function to find the maximum value in this array.

// 4. **Create an object that represents a car.**
//    Include properties like `make`, `model`, `year`, and `color`.
//    Print out: "My car is a [year] [color] [make] [model]."

// 5. **Write a function that takes a number as input and checks if it is even or odd.**
//    Return `"Even"` or `"Odd"`.

// 6. **Create an array of 10 numbers and write a function to sum them all up.**
//    Input: The array
//    Output: The total sum

// 7. **Create an object with a person's information.**
//    Include `name`, `age`, `gender`, and `hobbies` (an array of at least 3 hobbies).
//    Write a loop to display each hobby:
//    `"One of [name]'s hobbies is [hobby]."`

// 8. **Create an array of temperatures in Celsius.**
//    Write a function to convert each temperature to Fahrenheit and return the new array.
//    Formula: `(Celsius * 9/5) + 32 = Fahrenheit`

// 9. **Create a program to check if a string is a palindrome.**
//    Input: A word
//    Output: `true` if the word is a palindrome, otherwise `false`.

// 10. **Write a function to find the second largest number in an array.**
//     Input: `[4, 6, 2, 8, 5]`
//     Output: `6`
