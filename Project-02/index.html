        <h1>La Liga</h1>
        <p>
          The <b>Campeonato Nacional de Liga de Primera División</b>, commonly
          known as the Primera División or LaLiga and officially as LaLiga EA
          Sports since 2023 for sponsorship reasons, is the top men's
          professional football division of the Spanish football league system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since its inception,
          <a href="#" title="Check the team list">62 teams</a>
          have competed in La Liga. Nine teams have been crowned champions, with
          <a href="#" title="Learn more about Barcelona">Barcelona</a> winning
          the inaugural La Liga and
          <a href="#" title="Learn more about Real Madrid">Real Madrid</a>
          winning the title a record 36 times. Real Madrid also most recent

          and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs, winning several titles.
          Real Madrid and Barcelona dominated the championship in the 1950s,
          each winning four La Liga titles during the decade. During the 1960s
          and 1970s, Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning fourteen titles,
          with Atlético Madrid winning four. During the 1980s and 1990s Real
          Madrid were prominent in La Liga, but the Basque clubs of Athletic
          Club and Real Sociedad had their share of success, each winning two
          Liga titles. From the 1990s onward, Barcelona have dominated La Liga,
          winning seventeen titles to date. Although Real Madrid has been
          prominent, winning eleven titles, La Liga has also seen other
          champions, including Valencia and Deportivo La Coruña.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to UEFA's league coefficient rankings, La Liga was the top
          league in Europe in each of the seven years from 2013 to 2019
          (calculated using accumulated figures from five preceding seasons) and
          led Europe for 22 of the 60 ranked years up to 2019, more than any
          other country. It also produced the continent's top-rated club more
          times (22) than any other league in that period, more than double that
          of second-placed Serie A (Italy), including the top club in 10 of the
          11 seasons between 2009 and 2019; each of these pinnacles was achieved
          by either Barcelona or Real Madrid. La Liga clubs have won the most
          UEFA Champions League (19), UEFA Europa League (14), UEFA Super Cup
          (16) and FIFA Club World Cup titles, and its players have accumulated
          the highest number of Ballon d'Or awards (24), The Best FIFA Men's
          Player awards (19)[d] and UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards (12).
